## Seasonal Champagne Sales Prediction Using SARIMAX

### Business Understanding 😇
In today's world, the champagne industry is witnessing significant changes and challenges 🍾. With the rise of new competitors, changing consumer preferences, and evolving market dynamics, it has become crucial for companies like Perrin Freres to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions.

The monthly sales of Perrin Freres champagne, spanning from 1964 to 1972, hold valuable insights that can help the company understand market trends, anticipate demand fluctuations, and optimize production and distribution strategies 📈.

However, analyzing historical sales data manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. That's why in this project, we aim to leverage the power of data science and time series forecasting techniques to predict future sales with greater accuracy and efficiency.

By developing a SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) model tailored to Perrin Freres' sales data, we seek to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making. Whether it's identifying seasonal patterns, detecting underlying trends, or forecasting sales for the upcoming months, our goal is to equip Perrin Freres with the tools they need to thrive in a competitive market landscape 🚀.
